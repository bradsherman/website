Welcome to my website repository.

This was designed as a way for me to learn HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Bootstrap since I have had
little interaction with them before (besides taking courses at codecademy.com).
It is a working project and I hope to keep it up to date and improve it as my skill improves.

Let me know if you have any suggestions, and thanks for visiting!
